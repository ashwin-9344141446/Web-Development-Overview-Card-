                <h1>HTML builds the basic structure and content layout of every website.</h1>
                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web development. It defines the structure of web pages using elements like headings, paragraphs, forms, and images. Developers use HTML to organize content so browsers can display information clearly and logically.</p>

            <div class="left"> CSS – Styling and Visual Design<br>
                <h1>CSS controls the look, layout, and responsiveness of a website.</h1>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML elements with colors, spacing, animations, and layouts. It helps developers create visually appealing and responsive designs that work smoothly across different devices and screen sizes.</p>

            <div class="body"> .NET – Backend Application Framework <br>
                <h1>.NET is used to build secure, scalable server-side applications.</h1>
                <p>.NET is a development platform created by Microsoft to build modern web and backend applications. In full-stack development, it is mainly used to handle server-side logic, APIs, authentication, and application processing in scalable server-side applications. Developers commonly use C# with ASP.NET Core to create reliable and high-performance web applications. <br><br>

It provides strong security features, good performance, and cross-platform support, allowing applications to run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. With its structured architecture and reusable libraries, .NET helps developers build clean, maintainable, and scalable enterprise-level systems.</p>

            <div class="right"> JavaScript – Dynamic Web Interaction<br>
                <h1>JavaScript adds interactivity and real-time behavior to web pages.</h1>
                <p>JavaScript is a powerful scripting language used to create dynamic features like form validation, animations, and API data loading. It allows developers to build interactive user experiences and handle events without refreshing the page.</p>

            <div class="footer"> MS_SQL – Data Management System<br>
                <h1>MS-SQL stores structured application data.</h1>
                <p>Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system used to store application data securely. Developers use SQL queries to manage records, maintain data integrity, and support backend operations efficiently.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
